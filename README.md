# Regression_Mid-Project

# 1 The objective of the project
The main objective of this project is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. 
The senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tool.
Moreover, the first mission for this project is to check if some variables are explained by the target column 'Price' which is the market value of the houses. The second purpose is to see if the linear regression model fits to this data with the target.
